    %p
      The purpose of this web app is to provide a convenient way to search for
      guitar ads on AGF.

    %p
      It parses AGF's
      <a href="http://www.acousticguitarforum.com/forums/forumdisplay.php?f=17"
      target="_blank">classifieds forums</a> and displays results in a
      streamlined and responsive table. The data includes the last six months
      of posts, and is updated hourly.

    %p
      It is not affiliated with
      <a href="http://www.acousticguitarforum.com/forums/index.php"
      target="_blank">Acoustic Guitar Forum</a>.  However, I'd like to thank
      J.R. Rodgers, the owner of AGF, for permission to share this web app.

    %p
      I'd also like to thank the mods at
      <a href="http://www.larriveeforum.com/smf/index.php?action=forum"
      target="_blank">Larrivee Forum </a> for allowing me to include  their
      classifieds section.

      %b Update
      There is much less activity on the Larrivee,  Martin, and Blueridge
      classifieds, so these forums are parsed daily, not hourly.
