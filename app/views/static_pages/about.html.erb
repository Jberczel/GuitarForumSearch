<h1>About</h1>

<p>The purpose of this web app is to provide a convenient way to search for guitar ads on AGF.</p>

<p> It parses AGF's <a href="http://www.acousticguitarforum.com/forums/forumdisplay.php?f=17">classifieds forums</a> and displays results in a streamlined and responsive table. The data includes the last six months of posts, and is updated hourly.</p>

<p>It is not affiliated with <a href="http://www.acousticguitarforum.com/forums/index.php">Acoustic Guitar Forum</a>.  However, I'd like to thank J.R. Rodgers, the owner of AGF, for permission to share this web app.</p>

<p>If you have any questions or comments, feel free to contact me at jxberc at gmail dot com.</p>
